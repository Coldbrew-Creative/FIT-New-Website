Coldbrew Creative Notes:
-----------------------

-removing the id="page-header" (where 'page' is the corporate.html, etc) to put everything in a PHP header file
	-this was in the...
   </head>
   <body>
      <!-- Service Header-->
      <div class="col-md-12 service-header text-center" id="quinceanera-header">
         <!-- Navbar Fixed-->
         <nav class="navbar navbar-default">
            <div class="container-fluid">

    -section, and when removing the id it doesn't display in the header on each page
    -actually..... I might be wrong.. just taking note in case!
